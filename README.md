# Intro

This repository contains implementations of various path planning algorithms in both Python and C++. The project is organized into two main directories: python and C++. Each directory includes scripts to demonstrate and run path planning algorithms on simulated maps. The repositoryâ€™s goal is to provide a comparative study of algorithms in different languages and their efficiency in pathfinding tasks.
Directory Structure

    python/ - Contains Python implementations of path planning algorithms.
    C++/ - Contains C++ implementations of path planning algorithms.

# Running the Main Scripts

## Python

```
cd python
python3 main.py
```

## C++

```
cd C++
g++ main.cpp -o main
./main
```

Each main script will execute the available path planning algorithms on sample maps. Additional instructions for each algorithm can be found in the respective directories.
